ERG funding for this project through February 2025
- 

Clean watersheds needs survey
- verification of the existence of a treatment plant (with lat lon)
- discharge, discharge type
- population served
- does it discharge to another facility

- Access Database

- Population served was calculated by ERG for upstream populations, double counting was specifically avoided.

ISIS/NPDES permits database has all discharge facilities (most facilities).

We know the universe to about 99% (~17,544 systems)

Systems sometimes discharge into multiple other systems

we know population served at the lowest level of system (collection system)

## Available Sewershed Data
