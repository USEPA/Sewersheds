## Topographic Attributes of Sewersheds

### Join endpoints to sewershed polygons

Create a join table to match sewersheds to endpoints. Only keep 1:1 matches


### Extract elevation for endpoints using elevatr package

### Extract elevation profile for sewersheds

### Normalize elevations so that endpoints = 0 and associated sewersheds are adjusted to zero
This is done by subtracting the elevation at the endpoint from all elevations within the watershed

## Plot results

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
