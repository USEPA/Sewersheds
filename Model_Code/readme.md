# Model Code

This folder contains the code used to prepare input data, train and validate the machine learning model, and generate the final sewershed boundaries. The code is organized into the following subfolders:

**'Data_Prep'**
Contains scripts to prepare input data for model training and prediction. This includes processing CWNS data, geospatial data, and other relevant datasets.

**'Model'**
Contains scripts to train and validate the machine learning model, as well as generate the sewershed areas.

**'Validation'**
Contains scripts used to validate the methods used to generate sewersheds by applying them to the testing set POTWs and performing accuracy assessments.
