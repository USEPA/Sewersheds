<h1>Sewershed Data for Validation</h1>
<p>The model will need to be trained and tested on known sewershed polygons. The next step is to then identify polygons that we have that are appropriate for training / testing. To do this, we first load and combine all of the polygons we have into a single dataset. Each data source varies, meaning we need to be load each file individually, project it to a specified coordinate system and extract key data. For our base coordinate system we use WGS84.</p>
<p>There are two folders we are using that Rachel has uploaded to the teams site:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘State_Provided_Data’</li>
<li>‘Merged_State_Provided_and_Census_Places’</li>
