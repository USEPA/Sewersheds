### Sub-Product Description
This sub-product is being developed in collaboration with EPA's Office of Water/Office of Wastewater Management. The sub-product will geographically define the nation's wastewater collection systems (sewersheds). The Equity in Wastewater Infrastructure Mapping project will aid in the investigation of five efforts. 1.) To analyze how wastewater needs are distributed across the US population and provide the means to more effectively analyze the impacts of state revolving fund projects related to wastewater infrastructure. 2.) Wastewater surveillance: knowing the extent of sewersheds is paramount in understanding community level health trends through wastewater surveillance. One salient example is with the tracking of SARS-CoV-2 through wastewater-based models, as well as emerging contaminant surveillance. 3.) Knowing the geographic extent of sewersheds allows for better modeling of influent loads impacting treatment plants. 4.) Identifying gaps in centralized system services and providing state and federal support to decentralized communities 5.) Identifying gaps in service, and support EJ communities in accessing resources and funding.

ORD researchers will provide the geographic data necessary for meeting these five critical goals. Through advanced machine learning techniques, researchers can develop effective and robust models that accurately estimate the geographic extent of the nations' tens of thousands of municipal wastewater distribution systems. Where available, state and local data on sewershed boundaries and/or the prevalence of decentralized (septic) systems will be collected. This data will be used to train a machine learning model at the census block level geography. This training data will be paired with explanatory data such as the American Community Survey, remote sensing data, and digital elevation models to effectively train, validate, and apply the model nationally. The final product will be a public facing dataset of estimated utility scale sewersheds for the United States.
